# How to cook real Nissin Top Ramen
- Unpackage ramen and seasoning packet
- Place ramen in small pot
- Add seasoning packet
- Add just enough water to come 3/4 up the side of the ramen so it's salty as fuck
- (Optional) If you're not a total pussy you can add fuck loads of cayenne pepper
- Put on high heat and bring to boil.
- Once the block begins to become squishy rotate 180 degrees on the X axis
- Cook for about another minute so it's still crunchy
- Enjoy the any meal of champions
