This is where I record my food science!

Since I hate how when you follow the instructions on most premade food it turns out burn, cooked unevenly or undercooked. I've spent a lot of time perfecting the process of reheating various foods. I realized at some point if I made record of my findings they would officially be science. You're welcome.
