# Beer Cheese Sauce
I have spent the last year perfecting this recipe, but it is still evolving. It is inspired by Red Robin's beer pretzels and beer cheese appetizer, it's probably the closest thing to a "copy cat" that you will find.

*Pairs well with [Alton Brown's Homehade Soft Pretzels](https://altonbrown.com/homemade-soft-pretzels-recipe/)*

## Ingredients
- 1/8 of a white onion minced
- 1 Tbsp minced garlic
- 2 Tbsp butter
- 1 Tbsp. all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup __heavy__ whipping cream
- 1/2 cup beer
- 1 tsp better than bouillon (chicken)
- 1/2 tsp paprika (for a little heat, use cayenne pepper instead)
- A pinch of salt
- 6 oz __by weight__ of shredded extra sharp white cheddar

## Instructions
1) Melt butter over medium heat in a small sauce pan, then add the minced onion. Stir constantly until they are nicely caramelized being carful not to burn anything. Turn down the heat if necessary.
2) Add garlic, and continue to cook until it starts to brown just slightly.
3) Remove pan from heat, and stir in the flower until evenly combined.
4) Add heavy whipping cream, whisking until it's evenly combined.
5) Stir in beer, paprika, salt, and bouillon, then return to low heat, and gently whisk until it just starts to simmer and thicken.
6) Add the cheese a handful at a time, whisking between each handful until it fully melts and integrates with the sauce.
